In the "Data Transformation and Visualization" project, we tackle the challenge of preparing customer records from a CSV file (acw_user_data.csv) for meaningful analysis. 
The existing flat CSV structure requires conversion into nested structures such as "Vehicle," "Credit Card," and "Address" amongst others. Using standard Python libraries, we accomplish 
tasks including error handling for dependents column, creating JSON files for different customer segments, flagging problematic credit card entries, and calculating a "Salary-Commute" metric. 
The use of Pandas and Seaborn libraries for data visualization is employed, generating insights on salary and age, conducting univariate and multivariate plots, and providing the ability to save these plots. 
The code presentation emphasizes clarity, logic, and reusability, fostering efficient problem-solving.
